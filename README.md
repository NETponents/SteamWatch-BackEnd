# SteamWatch
## What is it?
SteamWatch is a web service that allows you to recieve updates from Valve's Steam service on your Microsoft Band 1/2.

## What do I need?
You will need the following things to get up and running:
- Your Steam ID (`http://steamcommunity.com/id/`***REALLY LONG NUMBER***)
- A smartphone with the Microsoft Health app
- A Microsoft Band 1 or 2

## Can I help?
Absolutely. Just make sure you read the guidelines in `~/CONTRIBUTING.md` before you start. You will need a MEAN environment on your local machine to run and debug SteamWatch.
